# TUI-C
TUI-C (Terminal User Interface in C) is exactly what the name says. It is intended for use in the iPodZero project, but can handle a ton of other uses.
The program is projected to be one file, but others may be needed for test versions, and one final file.

NOTE: this project is nothing major, and is meant to be an easy setup for anyone with a way to run and execute C code.
